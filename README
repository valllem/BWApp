INSTALLING
==================================

Download the file "Install-BWApp"
Right click the file and choose, "Run with Powershell"

Provided you have a standard desktop location (E.g. C:\users\<yourname>\desktop ) a shortcut will be placed on your desktop.
All the required files are now present.


RUNNING THE APP
==========================
Right click the shortcut on the desktop labelled BWApp and run with powershell.




NOTE: If the shortcut is not present go to "C:\BWApp\BWApp-master" and run the file called "Launcher.ps1" with powershell.
